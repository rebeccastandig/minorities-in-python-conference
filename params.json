{"name":"The Minorities in Python Conference","tagline":"Coming June 2015 in San Francisco, CA","body":"# Welcome to the site for the Minorities in Python Conference!\r\n\r\n\r\n## About the Minorities in Python Conference\r\nThe Minorities in Python Conference is a new conference for anyone who identifies as a minority in the Python community. All are welcome! You don't need to be an expert programmer (or even know how to code yet!) in order to participate. \r\n\r\n**If you don't identify as a minority in the Python community, you are still welcome to volunteer or help in whatever way you desire.** \r\n\r\nThis conference arose out of a need to have an inclusive, safe space to discuss minority-specific issues, ideas, and resources, as well as to bring together minorities in the Python community for networking, learning, sharing, and friendship. To that end, we ask that you adhere to our Code of Conduct (coming soon). \r\n\r\nThe first day of the Minorities in Python Conference will focus on teaching beginner and new programmers the basics of Python. Days 2 and 3 will consist of scheduled talks, lightning talks, and sprints.  \r\n\r\n## How Can You Help?\r\nWe're in need of a venue, funds, childcare providers, volunteers...pretty much everything you need to put on a conference. If you're interested in helping to organize the Minorities in Python Conference, donate funds or services, or any other form of assistance, please [email](minorities.in.python.conf@gmail.com) or [tweet](https://twitter.com/PyNorities) at the organizers.  \r\n\r\n### Organizers\r\n[Rebecca Standig](https://twitter.com/understandig) (@rebeccastandig on GitHub)\r\n\r\n### Volunteers\r\n\r\n### Sponsors\r\n\r\n### Support/Contact\r\nPull requests are always welcome!
